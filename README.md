# Javascript-Practice

The following are practice exercises and challenges based on the NSS curriculum.

The index page contains links to each individual challenge or exercise. Each exercise has a descriptive named .html file and associated .js or .css files. Output is rendered either in the console or directly to the DOM.

## Battle of the Bands

I developed a function to accept a band name from a text input and assign it a number. Starting with 1, each band name entered will be assigned the next incremented number.

But for multiples of five (5, 10, 15, etc.) "Chicken" will appear instead of the number and for the multiples of seven (7, 14, 21, etc.) "Monkey" will appear. For numbers which are multiples of both five and seven "ChickenMonkey" will appear.

## Cookout

I created a function that prints a series of incremented numbers to a DOM element.

The function accepts the following two arguments which will dictate the result of the output:

- increment value
- number of increments

The specified arguments will also appear in the text prior preceding the incremented output.

## Fibonacci Sequence

I created a function that accepts a number from the user and returns the integer in that place within the Fibonacci Sequence.

## Overly Excited

This is a function that takes
